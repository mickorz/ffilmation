FFilmation: AS3 isometric engine. Version history:
-------------------------------------------------

NEW

Nicer object shadows, that fade away as the object moves away from the plane. Try jumping in the demo to see it in action.
The Grid is now generated on-demand, only used cells are generated. No longer we create a huge array that covers the whole scene. This has a huge impact
in both initialization time and memory usage, and makes possible to have much bigger scenes. This is a gret improvement in my opinion.
Added Mouse translation coordinates and an A* pathfinding: all you need to program point-and-click adventuring and Diablo clones.
Added shadowQuality settings. Shadows are the main bottleneck of the engine, therefore there is a need to have quality options to adjust them to your requirements.
Added the fMaterialTypes class, where you can find info on the available materials and how to use them
Added the "fence" material
New zSort algorythm. It is cleaner and faster, and I hope this one will work properly.
Added the "xmlObj" property to elements
Added the "window" material.
Added the "animated" property to fObjects, which allows some optimization.
Added the fHole class, which gives control over holes in fPlanes. Now holes can be opened and closed. 
Added a Building Generator
Moved generators to new package "helpful" outside the engine, as they really do not belong there. Thnx to Jason Booth for the wisdom.
Sprite hierarchy is properly setup so you can add Mouse Events to fElements and the appropiate element receives the event.
Materials now tile seamlessly along adjacent surfaces.

FIXES

Fixed: The engine now assigns an internal unique ID to each element, and uses that id in internal hashtables instead of relying on the IDs you assign. This was causing lots of trouble.
Fixed: "BOX Tag" from generators were ignored
Fixed: Exception caused by shadow projection trying to calculate intersection between paralel lines.
Fixed: Several shadow projection bugs.
Fixed: Some collisions between objects were missed.
Fixed: mathUtils.getAngle now returns values consisten with the engine's coordinate system.

1.1:

NEW

Added coordinate-translation methods to fScene, so you can easily map Stage coordinates into game coordinates, or viceversa
Added camera occlusion
Added Scene controllers
Added enable/disable methods to the scene
Added Element controllers
Added Perlin Material
Added Door Material
Added Generator interface + SCATTER Generator
Implemented fScene.removeOmniLight

FIXES

Fixed fObject.hide() causing a zSort exception
Fixed createCharacter()
Fixed false shadows from floors to higher walls
Fixed a big performance botteneck that affected character movement

TODO
. Finish fObject shadowing models
. AI helpers: isElementVisibleFrom(), findPathTo(), findAmbushPathTo()

1.0: Initial Release

KNOW BUGS
. At creation time, If objects are placed beyond bounds some errors are not properly catched. Unless you're capturing everything
or are testing from inside the flash authoring tool, the engine stops working and you don't know what happened.

TODO
. Finish fObject shadowing models
. AI helpers: isElementVisibleFrom(), findPathTo(), findAmbushPathTo()
. Camera occlusion: assign a transparency percent to elements that are in front of the camera, you you can see what you're doing
. More material types
. Add more object libraries to the default release
