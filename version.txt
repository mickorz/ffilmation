FFilmation: AS3 isometric engine. Version history:
-------------------------------------------------


Added the "animated" property to fObjects, which allows some optimization.
Added the fHole class, which gives control over holes in fPlanes. Now holes can be opened and closed.
Sprite hierarchy is properly setup so you can add Mouse Events to fElements and the appropiate element receives the event.

KNOW BUGS
. At creation time, If objects are placed beyond bounds some errors are not properly catched. Unless you're capturing everything
or are testing from inside the flash authoring tool, the engine stops working and you don't know what happened.

TODO
. Finish fObject shadowing models
. AI helpers: isElementVisibleFrom(), findPathTo(), findAmbushPathTo()
